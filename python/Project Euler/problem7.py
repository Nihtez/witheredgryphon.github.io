# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

# What is the 10,001st prime number?

# Dev note: utilizing Millerâ€“Rabin primality test
# See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test
# https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test#Python (<-- code errors are listed in the primality
# test that have been corrected here)
#
# This primality test is probabilistic, and as a result the answer may not always be accurate.
# Would not recommend this for prime sets of 1 million or more as sieving is far more efficient at that point
