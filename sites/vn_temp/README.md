# /r/visualnovel's 2018 competition submission

This is my web creation for the /r/visualnovel's 2018 competition to re-design the recommendation chart for Visual Novels.

## What is this site?

I mainly designed this site with a more modern feel in mind.
The design concept came from a post I stumbled across on Reddit which suggested a Netflix style site as one way to approach the competition.

Not wasting any time I jumped on the opportunity and have incorporated concepts from Netflix—as well as other sites such as Steam and VNDB—to create a modern feel.

I also developed this site from the ground up with mobile in mind. While it's not perfect by any means, I hope to continue to develop responsively.

## The project

So far I've completed the basic framework for the website which allows me to easily and quickly create pages for Visual Novels.

As the competition progresses I hope to get some feedback from users to help me develop the site.

Even if the site doesn't win the competition I still plan on leaving it up for users to access if they like.
